# **This is a Tutorial on Timeline JS** #

- Timeline JS is an extremely versatile program you can use to create content-rich timelines. Timelines can be about any event or series of events you choose.
A note on choosing your Timeline Topic: while it can be used for events that are far apart (in time) it is most effective for events closer together.

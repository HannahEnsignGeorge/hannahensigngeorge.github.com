# **This is a Tutorial on Timeline JS** #

- Timeline JS is an extremely versatile program you can use to create content-rich timelines. Timelines can be about any event or series of events you choose.
  * A note on choosing your Timeline Topic: while it can be used for events that are far apart (in time) it is most effective for events closer together.

## A Basic Step-by-Step Guide to Create Your Timeline: Adapted from [Timeline JS at knight lab](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make) ##

1. Create your spreadsheet: download spreadsheet template and save to Google Drive [Timeline JS Spreadsheet Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L-BYrNCEAcSwn8Rr91uiYwee7VD-pK4x38auquRepm0/edit#gid=0)
    1. edit the timeline template to include the dates, text, links, and media specific to your project.
    
2. Publish to the Web
   1. Under the 'File' menu, select 'Publish to the Web'
   2. copy the URL from the top of the page

3. Generate your Timeline
   1. This feature hosts your timeline on the Timeline JS site. While it's here you can make changes on your spreadsheet and preview those changes.
   
4. Share your Timeline. Yay!

## Important Notes on Timeline JS: Tricks & Hints ##

  * When importing in Timeline, make sure the URL you use takes you straight to the image. A URL to a wikipedia page where the image is will NOT work in Timeline. On Wikimedia, there should be a button that says "Use this file on the web" which gives you the URL you're looking for. Or, right click on an image and select "Open in a new tab" which should give you a usable URL too.
  * When working with eras, make sure your eras have starting and end dates. Similarly, if you give the exact hour an event started, it needs to have an ending hour as well. 
  * Formatting Fun! To change the background of your Timeline slides, you can use hexadecimal color or an image URL. In my Timeline example I used both hexadecimal color codes and an image URL. Hexadecimal colors are html color codes. Google 'HTML color codes' or use [this page I used](https://html-color-codes.info/)

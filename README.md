# Welcome to my GitHub Page!
-This is where I am learning how to use GitHub & will be working on some projects.
--**Soon I will have a tutorial on how to use Timeline JS**

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/HannahEnsignGeorge/hannahensigngeorge.github.com/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Timeline JS

Timeline JS is an open-source tool that allows anyone to create content-rcih timelines. 
Do more than present content, give it to users in an interactive and compelling way.
1. Media forms you can use in your Timeline include Youtube, Vimeo, Wikipedia articles, tweets, audio files from Soundcloud, and more.
2. Customize your Timeline, with background colors and images. Use simple html formatting tags to change font size and color.
